She had a childlike heart and was interested in all kinds of cute toys.

Lin had a complex family situation.
She comes from a blended family where both parents each had a child before coming together and then had her.

When she was young, she was surrounded by many people and felt very happy.

But everything changed when she started elementary school.
Her father made money and had a change of heart, leading to frequent arguments with her mother, and they eventually divorced...

She and her mother moved to another place, and their economic situation was not as good as before. Her mother often brought other men home, telling her that they were "partners."

During that time, Lin struggled with depression and anxiety.
She later learned about being transgender and eventually confirmed her desire to be a girl.

She didn't have many companions, only two or three. One of them, a girl, was very good to her, and they often chatted together.

Her mother's boyfriend was physically abusive towards her. Even though her mother tried to stop it, she often suffered violence from him.

This was followed by a series of events: coming out, running away, returning home, and being beaten.

She was very afraid of pain but didn't know what to do...

She didn't understand why her family had become like this or how she had become who she was.

Later, there was self-harm, loneliness... and further mental breakdown.

Once, she wrote in a tweet:

> Friends, to me, are like: he is my only one, but I am just one of his. Afraid of loneliness, yet having to get used to loneliness.  
>
> Watching movies alone, playing games alone, going to the arcade alone, going to the hospital alone... living a bit of a failed life...  
>
> Afraid of being discovered by others, yet longing for their care. Sometimes a hug, a word of concern is more effective than any amount of medication, pretending to be normal, pretending to be cheerful all day...
>
> Turning off the phone, closing my eyes, the sense of loneliness comes rushing in, the past pains flashing before my eyes like a lantern...  

In the end, she chose to leave this world.

Lin once wrote: In the next life, I want to be a cat, no studying, no work, no worries, just meowing...

Hope that she can get her wish and be a cute, happy cat...
